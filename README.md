The goal of this project was to develop and implement a functioning, transparent, and reliable
electronic voting system to address the plethora of difficulties that have arisen primarily
because of the in-use voting systems in Kenya. The project entailed an E-Voting system that
employed the use of an Electronic Voting Machine and a Web Application that provided

easy-to-use interfaces for in-house and remote voting respectively. All components of the E-
Voting systems connected to a server framework and a database management server that

delivered dynamic data to the client applications. In the use of the web application system for
remote voters, a voter was authenticated using a one-time password and authorized to vote
once and the voter's identity was flagged after voting to prevent another attempt to vote. The
use of electronic voting machine for in-house voters, a voter was authenticated using
biometric scanning and authorized to vote once and the voter's identity was flagged after
voting to prevent another attempt to vote. The system used a secure MySQL database to
manage the election data, as well as monitor system logins. Data was securely transferred to
the database servers, and encrypted to reinforce data protection, guaranteeing that only
authorized individuals would have access to the information after voters make their choices.
This electronic voting system guaranteed security, convenience, and the integrity of an
election. The developed and implemented E-Voting system complemented the current voting
system used in Kenyaâ€™s general elections and leveraged security mechanisms that address the
problems in the implemented manual voting systems.
